# OpenTIM

An in-progress open source implementation of "The Incredible Machine" and "The Even More! Incredible Machine".

Goals:
- Run on desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). Requires the user to provide the original game assets.
- WebAssembly is a stretch goal. Not actively targeting it, but keeping it in mind.
- Simulation should be as accurate to the original game as possible.
- Try to keep simulation quirks. Simulation bugs carried over from the original game may be fixed if there's reasonable consensus that it's disruptive or game-breaking.


## Dev notes:

All bug fixes for the original game are labelled as "VANILLAFIX".
